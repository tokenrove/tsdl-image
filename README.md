Tsdl\_image â€” SDL2\_Image bindings for OCaml with Tsdl
------------------------------------------------------

Tsdl\_image provides bindings to
[SDL2_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) intended to
be used with [Tsdl](http://erratique.ch/software/tsdl).

It has as siblings [tsdl-mixer](https://github.com/tokenrove/tsdl-mixer)
and [tsdl-ttf](https://github.com/tokenrove/tsdl-ttf).

Note that these bindings are at an early stage and have only been used
minimally.  The interface may change.  Comments and bug reports are
welcome through the [github page](https://github.com/tokenrove/tsdl-image)
or by emailing Julian Squires <[julian@cipht.net](mailto:julian@cipht.net)>.

## Installation

Via [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/):

    opam install tsdl_image

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated with `ocamldoc`, but the binding
follows the SDL2_image interface closely, so it may be sufficient to
consult
[its documentation](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/docs/index.html).
